# Text Classification with BERT
This project demonstrates the application of a BERT-based model for text classification tasks. The project is implemented using **PyTorch** and involves various stages of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview
The project is focused on building and evaluating a text classification model using a dataset from Kaggle. The key steps involved in this project include:

**1) Data Loading and Preprocessing:**

Data is loaded from CSV files provided in the Kaggle dataset.
Text data is tokenized, cleaned, and prepared for model input using tools like NLTK and custom preprocessing functions.

**2) Model Implementation:**

A BERT-based model is implemented using the PyTorch framework.
The model architecture is designed to handle classification tasks, with appropriate layers and configurations for text data.

**3) Training and Evaluation:**

The dataset is split into training and validation sets using scikit-learn.
The model is trained and optimized using various hyperparameters, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.

**4) Results:**

The trained model is tested on unseen data, and results are reported in terms of accuracy and other relevant metrics.
